# Implementation of vehicle motion simulation with Unity.

 The objective of the work was to develop a design and implementation 
of a vehicle motion simulator using the capabilities of the Unity graphic engine. 

As part of the work, a flight simulator was developed, 
taking into account the influence of the most important physical forces. 
The technical parameters of two models of airplanes were used during the 
realization of the project: Cessna 172S “Skyhawk” and PZL M26 “Iskierka”.  

The application enables the presentation of the influence of the physical 
properties of the vehicle on the characteristic of flight, 
control and the presentation of these data on the 
implemented on-board instruments.
